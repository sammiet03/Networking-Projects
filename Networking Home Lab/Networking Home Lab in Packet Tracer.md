## Networking Home Lab in Packet Tracer
- For this project, I wanted to create a homelab through the use of Packet Tracer to save money. This home lab is where I will configure many networking devices and continue to practice the material I learned for the CCNA. 
- The general recommendation for a homelab consists of 3 Routers, 3 Switches, and 2 Laptops. This will allow you to build more complex topologies.  
- The 3 routers I will use in this homelab are a Cisco 2901, 2901, and a 4331. 
- The 2 switches I will use in this homelab are 2 Cisco 2960's, and a Cisco 3650 Layer 3 switch.
