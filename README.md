# Networking-Projects
#### Hello, here are some of the labs I have completed to help myself learn basic networking concepts and to study for the CCNA exam! As well as demonstrate my knowledge on fundamental computer networking topics. 
- All of these labs/projects have been creating using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
- Resources I used to study for the CCNA include Jeremy's IT Lab and Neil Anderson's CCNA course.
