### Connected Product Application Final Project - Fall 2022 

- For this project, I was given the assignment of creating a working model of a connected product application.
- This model could be designed around an exisiting system and for the project my teammates had decided to create a Smart Train

##### Project Requirements 
- Complete connectivity demonstrated by IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Local actuators that respond to local sensors and remote inputs via the "brokerage" of the cloud 
- Both a cloud mobile-oriented web page and a cloud IoT services page 
- At least one local and one global server, running IPv4 and IPv6 DNS, so web pages and IoT pages are accessible via a URL
- 2 workings LANs connected to 1 working access ISP
- 1 separate working Cloud/Data Center providing web and IoT services relevant to the smart train
- 1 working IPv4 and IPv6 routing core, with 3 tiers of ISP
- 1 Secured Data Center with multiple VLANs
